## üëã Welcome to the NPGW GitHub üëã

NPGW provides various APIs to help you accept payments on your website or mobile application.

This repository contains NPGW API definition files, represented in the [OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/) standard (formerly known as Swagger Specification).

The NPGW APIs have been created using the principles of REST. They will accept and return JSON-encoded bodies and responses, while using standard HTTP response codes & authentication.

### Merchant Registration

1. Once you have been successfully setup, our team will provide you with your unique `merchantId`.
2. Additionally a Merchant Service Account will be created for you to access the APIs.

## üìú Documentation

* [Technical Documentation](https://npgw.github.io/npgw-api-specification/)
* [OpenAPI specification](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NPGW/npgw-api-specification/main/api-merchant.yaml)

### Usage

There are multiple ways you can use the OpenAPI definition to explore the NPGW APIs:

* By using the classic Swagger toolset, upload these definitions to the [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/) or [SwaggerHub](https://swaggerhub.com/).
* By using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/postman) to import the API definition and create your personal collection of requests.
